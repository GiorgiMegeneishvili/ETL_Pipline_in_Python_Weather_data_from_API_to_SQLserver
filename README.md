# ETL_Pipline_in_Python_Weather_data_from_API_to_SQLserver

# 🌤️ ETL Pipeline in Python – Weather Data API → SQL Server

This project showcases a complete ETL pipeline in Python that fetches weather data via API and loads it into SQL Server.

## 🔧 Features

- Extracts current and historical weather data from open APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
- Transforms JSON responses into structured formats
- Loads data into SQL Server tables (using `pyodbc` or `pymssql`)
- Modular code organization in separate `extract/`, `transform/`, `load/` modules
